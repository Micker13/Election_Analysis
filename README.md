# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Exercise to investigate election results 

## Election Audit

The election team has requested our group perform an indepth audit of the Colorado election results to ensure correct tallies and results.  As elections are involve a high number of votes and have a wide ranging impact on the laws of the land, it is important to ensure transparency and reliability in the election process.  The analysis here will review the following conditions to ensure accuracy.

1. Total vote counts
2. Vote counter per candidate
3. Vote counts based on county
4. Voter turnout on a county basis
5. Percentage of votes won by each candidate

## Tools

Work was carried out using the provided dataset, jupyter notebook, and Visual Studio.

## Audit Summary

This script is a basic write up that can be used easily to breakdown future elections for efficient results.  Slight editing would be necessary to change the file references, but minimal other impacts.  This would also allow for mid election results to be visible as the script can be rerun as needed throughout an election night.  Further ideas may be to include vote registration information to build the capability to show how many votes are estimated to be outstanding (untallied / submitted so far).
